###### For this project, you will use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder.
This project aims to explore the possibility of the well-known tech giant, Microsoft , trying it's stake in the lucrative  
movie industry. This project will use datasets from movie industry giants such as box office to analyse the trends in 
movie industry so as to determine the best course of action that Microsoft 
should persue in order to make a big entry into the movie industry as is fitting
for a company of its stature.


### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
